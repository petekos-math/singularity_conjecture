# Singularity Conjecture
This survey is intended to be an up-to-date survey on the singularity conjecture, serving as an improved version of a brief survey outlined in the author's PhD thesis.

# Our goals

- First of all, we want to clarify the origins behind the singularity conjecture, giving proper attributions once and for all.
- Secondly, we aim to collect all results related to the singularity conjecture, taking the Furstenberg's theorem about Poisson boundaries of random walks on lattices in semisimple Lie groups as a starting point. In particular, we want to properly highlight which cases are solved and which are still open.
- Finally, we want to discuss the higher-dimensional and higher-rank generalizations of the singularity conjecture as well.

# What needs to be included

The introductory chapters lack all necessary prerequisites:
- Definition of the Poisson boundaries
- Definition of the hitting measures, with all recent developments concerning its existence and isomorphism with the Poisson boundary

We also plan to include some exercises, like showing the singularity conjecture in some simple cases.

Also, we want to outline the open cases. As the non-cocompact case is, essentially settled (even for Patterson-Sullivan measures for Fuchsian groups of second kind), we concentrate on the cocompact case.

- The conjecture is still open for nearest-neighbour RW's on Fuchsian groups corresponding to regular tessellations $\Delta_{4, 5}, \Delta_{8, 3}, \Delta_{10, 3}$. This should be doable via cleverly picking an small word-distance composition of side-pairing generators.
- The conjecture is open for non-nearest-neighbour RW's on Fuchsian groups corresponding to all regular tessellations.
- Also, we cannot extend our method to Fuchsian groups with non-symmetric fundamental polygons.
