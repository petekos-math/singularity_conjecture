# Singularity Conjecture
This survey is intended to be an up-to-date survey on the singularity conjecture, serving as an improved version of a brief survey outlined in the author's PhD thesis.

# Our goals

- First of all, we want to clarify the origins behind the singularity conjecture, giving proper attributions once and for all.
- Secondly, we aim to collect all results related to the singularity conjecture, taking the Furstenberg's theorem about Poisson boundaries of random walks on lattices in semisimple Lie groups as a starting point. In particular, we want to properly highlight which cases are solved and which are still open.
- Finally, we want to discuss the higher-dimensional and higher-rank generalizations of the singularity conjecture as well.
