# Singularity Conjecture
This is a collaborative effort in order to collect all existing results related to the singularity conjecture and oultine existing approaches to its resolution.

# Our goals

- First of all, we want to clarify the origins behind the singularity conjecture, giving proper attributions once and for all.
- Secondly, we aim to collect all results related to the singularity conjecture, taking the Furstenberg's theorem about Poisson boundaries of random walks on lattices in semisimple Lie groups as a starting point. In particular, we want to properly highlight which cases are solved and which are still open.
- Finally, we want to discuss the higher-dimensional and higher-rank generalizations of the singularity conjecture as well.
